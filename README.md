# Question-Answer System based on SPARQL Queries

This mini project implements a question-answer system that allows users to pose questions in natural language and receive accurate responses based on SPARQL queries. The system leverages the web of data to extract information and presents the answers through a simple user interface.

## Project Structure

- `interface.html`: Basic homepage for user interaction.
- `Backend.js`: Holds SPARQL queries for different questions.
- `Styling.css`: Keeps the CSS styling for the homepage interface.
- `README.md`: Documentation file providing project details.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `interface.html` in a web browser.

## Usage

1. Access the homepage and select a question from the provided list.
2. The system will generate and execute a SPARQL query based on the selected question.
3. The answer will be retrieved from the DBpedia endpoint and displayed on the user interface.

## Queries

- Our SPARQL queries utilize a range of features such as OPTIONAL, FILTER, ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET, GROUP BY, and UNION.
- And test values using at least one boolean operator, one comparator, or one arithmetic operator.

Feel free to contribute or report issues. Happy querying!
